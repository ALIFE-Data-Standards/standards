# Phylogeny Standard

A phylogeny is a tree that describes ancestor-descendant relationships in a collection
of individuals.

## Required Fields

These are the minimum set of fields required to specify a phylogeny. You must have
this information to conform to the standard.

- id
- ancestor_list

## Conventional Fields

These are conventional, but not required fields, for describing phylogeny. If you
have any of this information in your data, you should format it conventionally.

- origin_time
- destruction_time
