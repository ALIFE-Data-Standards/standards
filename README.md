# ALIFE Data Standards

The Artificial Life (ALIFE) community is awash with disparate software systems, many of which produce data about the same underlying processes. This results in duplicated effort in developing analysis tools and visualizations. We believe we can fix this problem by developing a community consensus around digital standards for common data types (e.g., genomes, phylogenies, etc.). These standards will be useful to a wide range of artificial life systems, including artificial chemistries, abstract ecologies, evolutionary systems, and a range of other communities who express interest. Eventually, this repository will hold a generally-accepted specification for these standards, but much discussion is sill required to get to that point.

Currently, this repository contains proposed draft specifications for the standards and exists primarily as a home for further discussion to finalize them.
