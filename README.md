# ALIFE Data Standards

The Artificial Life (ALIFE) community is awash with disparate software systems,
many of which produce data about the same underlying processes. This results in duplicated effort in developing analysis tools and visualizations. This workshop aims to start a community-level discussion about developing digital standards for common data types (e.g., genomes, phylogenies, etc.). This workshop aims to start a conversation about identifying best practices and developing data and tool standards amongst individuals who design, develop, and use a wide range of artificial life systems, including artificial chemistries, abstract ecologies, evolutionary systems, and a range of other communities who express interest.
